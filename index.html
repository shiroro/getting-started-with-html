<h1>Important Concepts</h1>

<b>The World Wide Web</b>
<p>The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML documents started in the early 1990s that now consists of 30+ billion pages. Pages are connected via links, which is how users navigate from one document to another.</p>

<b>HTTP</b>
<p>HTTP is short for <b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol.</b> It allows users to make requests from the internet, which retrieves files from servers, which are other computers that host files such as web pages.</p>
 
<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML is short for <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b> and is the basis of all pages on the World Wide Web. It can consist of text content (what's visible on the page), markup (the code that a computer renders as a web page), references to other types of documents such as images or videos, and links to other pages. HTML is made up of <b>tags</b> consisting of < and > signs to open and < / and > signs to close them. These tags can be nested. </p>
  
  <b>HTML Attributes</b>
  <p>HTML tags can have multiple attributes. The anchor tag, for example, can be given a value that transforms a piece of text into a hyperlink like <a href="www.zombo.com">this one</a>. Unlike anchor tags, image tags are <b>void</b> tags as they have no closing tags.</p>
  <b>Whitespace</b>
  <p>In HTML, text on multiple lines renders as a single line unless you tell it to render otherwise. Some options for doing this include the BREAK tag, which is a void tag that creates multiple lines, or the P tag, which is a block, or an invisible box around the content being rendered.</p> 
  
  <b>HTML Documents</b>
  <p>An HTML document contains a number of elements, including formatting, headers (which tell the browser such details as page title via metadata), the body (where we're currently working), and others.</p>
  
  <b>Computers Aren't That Bright</b>
  <p>Computers take things ultra-literally. They can't compensate for bad programming and can fail, crash, or otherwise misbehave in the event that they're provided with bad information, unlike a human.</p>
